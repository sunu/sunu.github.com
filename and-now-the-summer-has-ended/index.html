    <p>So the end is here. 24th August was the "hard pencil down" date of GSoC 2015. And with that GSoC has come to an end.</p>
<p>In the end, we have come fairly close to the goals we set in the beginning. Splash now has a branch which runs on Qt5. My <a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/pull/251">pull request</a> for Python 3 support, updated installation documentation and updated Docker images is waiting for a final review. Unfortunately, we've encountered a <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-47654">bug in QtWebkit</a> that is blocking us from merging the Qt5 branch into master for now.</p>
<p>But all in all this has been a wonderful experience. I have learned a lot this summer; at least I think I know a lot more about asynchronous programming and debugging now, than I knew before the summer. I have contributed to Twisted, which I have <a href="http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2014-04-27#i_3338742">tried doing and failed</a> in the past.</p>
<p>Next step will be to keep things tidy until the Qt bug is fixed. Also, I plan to port some more Twisted packages (like twisted.conch.telnet) that we use in Splash. There are several issues open that talk about easily extending Splash's functionalities through a library of Lua scripts using <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripting-tutorial.html#custom-lua-modules">custom Lua module support</a>. This is something I'm interested in working on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the end of GSoC means I am no longer working full time on anything. So I have actively started looking for interesting career opportunities. Do let me know if you have something in mind.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
