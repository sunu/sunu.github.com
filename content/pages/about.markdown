##### Hi! I'm Tarashish. People know me as "sunu" on the web and elsewhere.

I code; mostly in [Python](https://www.python.org/), have a degree in Computer Science from a [local college](http://cet.edu.in/) in my hometown - [Bhubaneswar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar), India.

I have contributed to several opensource projects like [OpenHatch](https://openhatch.org/), [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/), [MoinMoin Wiki](http://moinmo.in/MoinMoin2.0) and a bunch of [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) projects. I gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBV_KKGzNqQ) at [EuroPython 2014](https://ep2014.europython.eu/) in Berlin, Germany on WebRTC.

I'm also a casual gamer, cricket and soccer fan and [Friends](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/) is my favorite TV show. I read Game of Throne [tinfoil](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tinfoil+hat) theories and browse [/r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww) in my free time.
