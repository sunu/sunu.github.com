[Mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) is a nifty little tool that lets us intercept and manipulate http (and https) traffic on the fly. It's a man-in-the-middle proxy with both a commandline interface and a web interface to inspect, record and manipulate the http traffic. I have been playing with it this evening and I'll try to share whatever I have found out till now.

So let's install mitmproxy and have some fun. Installing mitmproxy was straight forward:

	$ pip install mitmproxy

Now we have to generate the dummy ssl certificates by running `mitmproxy` for the first time. The generated certificates should be in `~/.mitmproxy`.

Now we have to add the certificate to our browser. [Here is the official guide](http://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/firefox.html) for Firefox. Also install [this add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/toggle-proxy-51740/) for quick proxy switching in the future. Use 0.0.0.0:8080 as your proxy address and port and we are all set.

If we run `mitmproxy` now and try to visit `google.com` in our browser we can see the request being logged in the console. Here's what mine looks like.

We can alaso use `mitmdump` to record the requests and responses to a file and later replay them using `mitmproxy`.

Now the coolest thing (that I know of) is that `mitmproxy` lets you manipulate traffic on the fly by executing inline scripts. Some examples of inline scripts are included in the repo. Let's execute [this](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/examples/upsidedownternet.py) example which rotates all png images by 180Â°. We can use this script by running:

	$ mitmproxy --script /path/to/upsidedownternet.py

Inspired by this script I wrote a script to replace all images with the picture of a cute kitten. (Yes, I'm helping the kitten army take over the Internet ;))

Here's a screenshot of my Twitter timeline with the script running.

Here's the source of my script.

```python

# cat_apocalypse.py

import cStringIO
from libmproxy.protocol.http import decoded


def response(context, flow):
	if flow.response.headers.get_first("content-type", "").startswith("image"):
    with decoded(flow.response):
        try:
            img = cStringIO.StringIO(open('kitty.png', 'rb').read())
            flow.response.content = img.getvalue()
            flow.response.headers["content-type"] = ["image/png"]
        except:
            pass
```

Now running `mitmproxy --script cat_apocalypse.py` fills our http traffic with pictures of our cute little friend.
