Time for a short GSoC update.

I have a [PR](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/pull/251) open that makes all the tests in [Splash codebase](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/tree/master/splash/tests) pass on Python 3. It's up for review now.

Meanwhile twisted.web.proxy is [now available on Python 3](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7939) and I'm working on fixing a [related bug](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7981).
