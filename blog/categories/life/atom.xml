    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I visited <a href="http://www.nandankanan.org/">Nandankanan</a>, a zoo near <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> with friends :) . The zoo is mostly famous for the white tigers among other things. Mostly it was a memorable but somewhat disappointing outing.</p>

<p>The numbers of the animals on display was disappointing . We could see like 2 tigers , a lion-lioness pair , a zebra , a giraffe .There was no Orangutan , no bear . Most cages (or whatever I should call them) were empty. Disappointing . I was expecting more numbers of tigers at least. Anyway perhaps our timing was wrong or something. There was a chimpanzee. But I couldn't see it because of some people yelling at it.(Yes. there WAS a BIG RED SIGN saying "SILENCE PLEASE" and those people seemed literate enough to read and understand it.) The chimp never got out of its hiding. That was the biggest disappointment of all. :( And yeah the zoo restaurant was closed too.</p>

<p>On the better side we saw a white tiger. The birds and reptile sections had a good variety of creatures. And above all I learned how to use my camera properly and had a great time with friends :). Here are some photographs we took.</p>
