##### People know me as "sunu" on the web and elsewhere.

I code; mostly in [Python](https://www.python.org/), study Computer Science in a [local college](http://cet.edu.in/) here in [Bhubaneswar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar), India.

I have contributed to several opensource projects like [OpenHatch](https://openhatch.org/), [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/), [MoinMoin Wiki](http://moinmo.in/MoinMoin2.0) and a bunch of [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) projects. I gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBV_KKGzNqQ) at [EuroPython 2014](https://ep2014.europython.eu/) in Berlin, Germany on WebRTC.

I mostly code in Python and Javascript. Now a days I'm learning [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/).

I'm also a casual gamer, cricket and soccer fan and [Friends](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/) is my favorite TV show.
