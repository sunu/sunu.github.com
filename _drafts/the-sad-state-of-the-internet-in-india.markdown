title: The sad state of the Internet in India
---

Here's a simple truth: the Internet can change lives. At least it changed mine for the good. The Internet made me a programmer. Back in 2010 I just a kid with lots of time to waste, a new internet connection, a computer and no knowledge about computers whatsoever. Fast forward to 2015, I can code effectively in multiple languages, I can make my computer do stuff for me. I have found a new hobby that I love; a hobby that can earn me a decent living. All of it thanks to the Internet. No one in my family knew how to code, nor did any of my friends. The Internet taught me to code. I have learnt far more from the Internet than I have learnt in 3.5 years in college now. So yeah the Internet change my life and probably many others' too.

But the sad thing is the current scenario of the Internet in India is really fucked up. And unless we actively do something about it the situation will get more and more messy.

A decade ago internet connectivity might have been considered a luxury but in 2015 it's a necessity. [Right to Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access) has also been considered as a basic human right [by the UN](http://mashable.com/2012/07/06/internet-human-right/). But India has a Interntet penetration of less than 20%. That means more than 80% of the population does not have access to the Internet.

Some people may think it's because of the prevelant poverty and all, but let me tell you the rate of mobile phone connections in India is [74.16 per 100 citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_mobile_phones_in_use). So internet penetration should be at least close to half of that.

I can think of three different reasons:

- Internet connection is simply not available.
- Prices are simply ridiculous.
- Some people simply think an internet connection is unnecessary
- And lastly there is poverty.

The 4th issue needs a separate discussion on its own. Let's discuss all the other issues.

###Availability

Internet availability in India is simply abysmal. The infrastructure is not there and there is no effort being made to improve the situation. (Note: Superficial efforts don't count. They tell me they'll make 4G available in 2015, but you know what I don't even have access to 3G yet. My state government tells me they'll make the state capital [fully WiFi enabled](http://www.orissadiary.com/CurrentNews.asp?id=53208). But they can not even provide proper broadband to people of the city yet.)

3G is only available in a few cities. Other than a few metro cities broadband is limited in terms of both connectivity and available choices. The only way people get to access the Internet in most rural areas is through rediculously priced mobile network which also has limited availability in some cases.

As a country that relies heavily on IT outsourcing business to power its economy, one would expect the Government to spend more on internet infrastructure.But [our country spends about 1% of its GDP on technology](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/DCPVAGZdlH8e9FDpHm0yTN/Indian-technology-industry-likely-to-grow-to-18-trillion-b.html), compared to 2.5% around the world.

### Bandwidth and Affordability
