    <p>GSoC update time! In case you didn't read my previous post, I'm <a href="http://sunu.in/on-summer-of-code/">participating in GSoC</a> and porting <a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash">Splash</a> to Python 3.</p>
<p>Quick update on what has been done so far. The pull request to add support for Qt5 and PyQt5 has been merged into the <a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/tree/qt5">qt5 branch</a>. The plan is to merge it into <code>master</code> after Python 3 porting and some other cleanup(fixing the docs, Vagrantfile etc) is done.</p>
<p>So now on to Python 3 porting.</p>
<p>The main road block in porting Splash to Python 3 is that some dependencies don't (fully) support Python 3 yet. The major one at that is <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>. But the good thing is the most used parts of Twisted already support Python 3 and the developers behind Twisted are actively working on porting more and more modules. Also Twisted has a fairly well laid out <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3">guide for Python 3 porting</a> and the community is really responsive with feedback and reviews. Thanks to that I have ported a module already and working on porting <code>twisted.web.proxy</code> for now.</p>
<p>Among other dependencies, <a href="https://github.com/sunu/qt5reactor">my fork of qt5reactor</a> is Python 3 compatible. And <a href="https://github.com/axiak/pyre2/">pyre2</a>, a faster drop-in replacement of the <code>re</code> module from standard library, is now Python 3 compatible after <a href="https://github.com/axiak/pyre2/pull/31">my PR</a> was merged.</p>
<p>For now, I'm porting the Splash code base one test at a time. Splash has a good test coverage and lots of tests. So that's working in my favor. That and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html">pdb</a>.</p>
<p>That's all I have to share for now. Thanks for reading.</p>
